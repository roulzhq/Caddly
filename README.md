# Caddly - Easy Caddyfile editing
### Caddly let's you interactively create [Caddyfiles](https://caddyserver.com/tutorial/caddyfile).

Even though Caddyfiles have an easy Syntax and are supported in a lot of IDEs and Editors, We thought about how nice it would be to create a server config without having to think about syntax, looking up directives and more.
With Caddly, you can just drag and drop the required directives, configure them (properties just need to be filled in) and export them in minutes.

## Features
- Drag-and-drop adding of directives
- Templates for directives
- Creating multiple sites
- File-export, preview, changable indentation and editing before export
- Direct links to the Caddy documentation

## Todo
- input-validation
- dynamic directives (See [Issue #1](https://github.com/roulzhq/Caddly/issues/1)

## Caddly is still under development.
At the moment there are some known bugs, some of them limit the functionality of directives. (See Issues or KNOWN_BUGS.MD).

**Feel free to contribute!** This project is completely open-source and just to make the lives of Caddy-users easier.

The Favicon for caddly.roulz.com is property of the [Caddy](https://caddyserver.com/) Project! The name, obviously, was heavily inspired by Caddy.

Caddly and Roulz are not related to Caddy in any way - we just want it to grow, because we love the project!
